# Portfolio

In this project I created my own portfolio page for future employers to see. My portfolio has three main sections: about me, my projects and contact information. I chose to use tailwind as a CSS framework as I found it easy to make the website responsive.

## Technologies Used

* html
* tailwind

## Criteria that I met to achieve this

* Have displayed contact information so that the user can contact me.
* Links to my Github,LinkedIn and a downloadable PDF of my resume so that the user can see my credentials and other work.
* Display pieces of my work in "My Projects" section, which when clicked it takes you to that deployed application.
* Each application project has: a title,link to the deployed version, link to the GitHub repository and a screenshot of the deployed application.
* polished mobile responsive interface
* Clicking the links in the navigation bar causes the UI to scroll to the corresponding section.
* The first application is larger in size than the other images.
